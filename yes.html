            <p>Ariana, Nini Qoshang Chika,</p>
            <p>This is the first Valentine where we are not alone. I'm so lucky to have a angel like you with me on this day.</p>
            <p>I am not very good at this, but 90% of this was AI help. But I want to make you smile even though I can't hold you in my arms.</p>
            <p>You know how much I love you. I will die for you. Thanks for being with me.</p>
